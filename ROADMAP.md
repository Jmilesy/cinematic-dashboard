# Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned direction for the Home Assistant Bible &
Cinematic Dashboard project. It provides a clear, structured view of upcoming
work, long‑term goals, and the evolution of the architecture.

The roadmap is intentionally high‑level and stable.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation (Complete)

- Establish repository structure
- Create core documentation
- Define collaboration rules for AI agents
- Set up example folders and asset structure
- Add issue templates, PR templates, and labels

Status: Complete

---

## Phase 2 — Documentation Architecture (In Progress)

- Expand architecture documentation
- Define dashboard structure and naming conventions
- Document sensor and template rules
- Document theme structure and cinematic principles
- Create development workflow and decision log

Status: Ongoing

---

## Phase 3 — Example Configuration Set (Upcoming)

- Build modular sensor examples
- Build modular template examples
- Create dashboard example structure
- Add theme examples
- Add resource structure examples

Status: Planned

## Phase 4 — Cinematic Dashboard Prototyping (Ongoing)

- Prototype cinematic header concepts
- Test ambient effects and glow layers
- Explore responsive layout patterns
- Build experimental card designs
- Validate transitions and motion rules

Status: Active in `experiments/`

---

## Phase 5 — Documentation Promotion (Upcoming)

- Promote validated experiments into documentation
- Create clean examples in `config-examples/`
- Update architecture files with finalised patterns
- Record decisions in `docs/development.md`

Status: Planned

---

## Phase 6 — Refinement and Expansion (Future)

- Expand glossary and terminology
- Add advanced examples
- Improve onboarding documentation
- Add visual diagrams and mockups
- Refine cinematic theme structure

Status: Future

## Long‑Term Vision

- A complete, future‑proof reference architecture for Home Assistant
- A cinematic, responsive dashboard with modular components
- A stable environment for multi‑AI collaboration
- Clear documentation for every architectural decision
- A repository that is easy to navigate, extend, and maintain

---

## Purpose Summary

This roadmap provides:

- direction
- clarity
- predictable planning
- a shared vision for contributors
- a stable path for future development

It should be updated as the project evolves.
