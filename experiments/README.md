# Experiments

The `experiments/` directory is the sandbox for the Cinematic Dashboard
development environment. Everything here is exploratory, temporary, and allowed
to break. This folder exists so new ideas can be tested without affecting the
authoritative documentation or the reference examples.

Nothing in this folder is considered final or stable.

---

## Purpose of This Folder

- Prototype cinematic dashboard layouts
- Test header effects, animations, and transitions
- Explore new card designs and view structures
- Trial alternative sensor or template patterns
- Experiment with theming, colour systems, and UI flows
- Validate ideas before they move into documentation or examples

This is the creative playground of the project.

## Rules for Experiments

1. Experiments must never overwrite or replace the reference examples.
2. Experiments must not be treated as authoritative.
3. Experiments may break, change rapidly, or be discarded.
4. Experiments should be clearly named and scoped.
5. If an experiment becomes valuable, document it in `docs/` before promoting
   it.
6. Do not duplicate logic across experiments and reference examples.
7. No destructive edits outside this folder.

## Typical Experiment Types

### Dashboard Layouts

Testing:

- view structures
- card groupings
- responsive behaviour
- cinematic transitions

### Header Concepts

Exploring:

- glow layers
- atmospheric effects
- motion rules
- dynamic states

### Card Prototypes

Trying out:

- waste collection blocks
- presence summaries
- weather blocks
- system status cards

### Theme Experiments

Playing with:

- colour palettes
- light and dark modes
- gradients
- ambient overlays

## Workflow for Promoting an Experiment

1. Build and refine the prototype here.
2. Validate the idea in isolation.
3. Document the concept in `docs/`.
4. Create a clean, minimal example in `config-examples/`.
5. Update the changelog.
6. Remove or archive the experiment if no longer needed.

## Purpose Summary

This folder provides a safe, isolated space for:

- creativity
- iteration
- rapid prototyping
- UI exploration
- cinematic experimentation

It keeps the rest of the repository stable, predictable, and
documentation‑first.
