# Assets Folder

The `assets/` directory contains all non-code visual and media resources used by
the Home Assistant Bible & Cinematic Dashboard project. These files support
documentation, UI mockups, theming, and the cinematic dashboard development
environment.

This folder does **not** contain any live Home Assistant assets.  
Everything here is reference-only.
