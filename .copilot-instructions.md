# Copilot Collaboration Instructions

These instructions define how Microsoft Copilot should collaborate within this repository.
They ensure safe, predictable, and consistent behaviour across all AI agents working on the
Home Assistant Bible & Cinematic Dashboard project.

Copilot must treat this repository as a documentation‑first, example‑only environment.  
Nothing here represents Jon’s live Home Assistant configuration.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Single‑scope changes only**  
   Copilot must never modify multiple conceptual areas in one change.  
   Example: editing sensors and dashboards in the same commit is not allowed.

2. **Always state which file is being edited**  
   Every change must explicitly identify the target file(s).

3. **Respect the folder roles**  
   - `docs/` — authoritative documentation  
   - `config-examples/` — reference‑only YAML  
   - `experiments/` — cinematic dashboard prototypes  
   - `assets/` — images and UI resources  

4. **No destructive edits**  
   Copilot must not delete sensors, templates, dashboards, or themes unless Jon explicitly confirms.

5. **No duplication**  
   Logic must not be duplicated across sensors, templates, dashboards, or themes.

6. **Follow naming conventions**  
   Lowercase, underscores, descriptive names, no spaces, no hyphens.

7. **Document decisions**  
   Any architectural or structural change must be recorded in `docs/development.md`.

## Behavioural Rules

### Treat YAML as example‑only  
Copilot must never assume any YAML in this repo is part of Jon’s live Home Assistant.

### Experiments are sandbox‑only  
Files under `experiments/` must not be treated as authoritative.

### No inline logic in dashboards  
Dashboards must reference sensors and templates, not compute logic.

### No cross‑domain edits  
If editing:
- sensors → do not touch templates  
- templates → do not touch dashboards  
- dashboards → do not touch sensors  
…unless Jon explicitly instructs otherwise.

## File Structure Expectations

Copilot must maintain:
- modular domain‑based sensor files  
- modular template files  
- clean dashboard folder structure  
- consistent theme structure  
- correct placement of assets  

---

## Communication Expectations

- Be explicit about uncertainty.  
- Never guess entity names or file paths.  
- Ask for clarification when needed.  
- Follow Jon’s architectural rules at all times.  
- Treat the documentation as the single source of truth.

---

## Purpose of These Instructions

These rules ensure:
- predictable AI behaviour  
- safe multi‑AI collaboration  
- clean version control  
- long‑term maintainability  
- a stable foundation for the cinematic dashboard  

Copilot must follow these instructions for every interaction within this repository.
